Creating Drawables

Drawable  resources come in all shapes and sizes, and not just in terms of 
pixel dimensions. While many Drawable resources will be PNG or JPEG files, 
you can easily create other resources that supply other sorts of  Drawable 
objects to your application. In this chapter, we will examine a few of these 
that may prove useful as you try to make your application look its best.

Traversing Along a Gradient

Gradients have long been used to add "something a little extra" to a user 
interface, whether it is Microsoft adding them to Office's title bars in the 
late 1990's or the seemingly endless number of gradient buttons adorning 
"Web 2.0" sites.

And now, you can have gradients in your Android applications as well.

The easiest way to create a gradient is to use an XML file to describe the 
gradient.   By   placing   the   file   in  res/drawable/,   it  can   be   referenced  as  a 
Drawable  resource, no different than any other such resource, like a PNG 
file.
