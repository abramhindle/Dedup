Figure 5. The MeterDemo application

Note   that   there   is   a   significant   shortcut   we   are   taking   here:   our  Meter 
implementation and its consumer (MeterDemo) are in the same Java package. 
We   will   expose   this   shortcut   in  a  later   chapter  when  we   use   the  Meter 
widget in another project.

Change of State

Sometimes,   we   do   not   need   to   change   the   functionality   of   an   existing 
widget, but we simply want to change how it looks. Maybe you want an 
oddly-shaped  Button, or a  CheckBox  that is much larger, or something. In 
these cases, you may be able to tailor instances of the existing widget as you 
see fit, rather than have to roll a separate widget yourself.

Changing Button Backgrounds

Suppose you want a Button that looks like the second button shown below:

Moreover, it needs to not just sit there, but also be focusable:

...and it needs to be clickable:

Figure 8. The FancyButton application, showing a pressed oval-shaped button

If you did not want the look of the Button to change, you could get by just 
with a simple android:background attribute on the Button, providing an oval 
PNG. However, if you want the Button to change looks based on state, you 
need to create another flavor of custom Drawable – the selector.

A selector Drawable is an XML file, akin to shapes with gradients. However, 
rather than specifying a shape, it specifies a set of other Drawable resources 
and the circumstances under which they should be applied, as described via 
a series of states for the widget using the Drawable.

For example, from Views/FancyButton, here is res/drawable/fancybutton.xml, 
implementing a selector Drawable:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item
    android:state_focused="true" 
    android:state_pressed="false" 
    android:drawable="@drawable/btn_oval_selected"

  />
  <item
    android:state_focused="true" 
    android:state_pressed="true"
    android:drawable="@drawable/btn_oval_pressed"
  />
  <item
    android:state_focused="false" 
    android:state_pressed="true"
    android:drawable="@drawable/btn_oval_pressed"
  />
  <item
    android:drawable="@drawable/btn_oval_normal"
  />
</selector>

There are four states being described in this selector:

1. Where the button is focused (android:state_focused = "true") but 

not pressed (android:state_pressed = "false")

2. Where the button is both focused and pressed

3. Where the button is not focused but is pressed

4. The default, where the button is neither focused nor pressed

In   these   four   states,   we   specify   three  Drawable  resources,   for   normal, 
focused, and pressed (the latter being used regardless of focus).

If we specify this selector  Drawable  resource as the  android:background of a 
Button, Android will use the appropriate PNG based on the status of the 
Button itself:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="horizontal"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
>
  <Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Click me!"
  />
  <Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"

  />
</LinearLayout>

Changing CheckBox States

The   same   basic   concept   can   be   used   to   change   the   images   used   by   a 
CheckBox.

In this case, the fact that Android is open source helps, as we can extract 
files   and   resources   from   Android   and   adjust   them   to   create   our   own 
editions, without worrying about license hassles.

For  example,  here   is  a  selector  Drawable  for a  fancy  CheckBox, showing a 
dizzying array of possible states:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <!-- Enabled states -->
      
    <item android:state_checked="true" android:state_window_focused="false"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_on" />
    <item android:state_checked="false" android:state_window_focused="false"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_off" />

    <item android:state_checked="true" android:state_pressed="true"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_on_pressed" />
    <item android:state_checked="false" android:state_pressed="true"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_off_pressed" />

    <item android:state_checked="true" android:state_focused="true"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_on_selected" />
    <item android:state_checked="false" android:state_focused="true"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_off_selected" />

    <item android:state_checked="false"
          android:state_enabled="true"
          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_off" />
    <item android:state_checked="true"

          android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_on_disable" />
    <item android:state_checked="false" android:state_window_focused="false"

android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_off_disable" />
    <item android:state_checked="true" 
android:drawable="@drawable/btn_check_on_disable" />

</selector>

Each of the referenced PNG images can be extracted from the android.jar 
file in your Android SDK, or obtained from various online resources. In the 
case of Views/FancyCheck, we zoomed each of the images to 200% of original 
size, to make a set of large (albeit fuzzy) checkbox images.

Figure 9. An example of a zoomed CheckBox image

In   our   layout,   we   can   specify   that   we   want   to   use   our 
res/drawable/fancycheck.xml selector Drawable as our background:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content"
>
  <CheckBox

    android:layout_width="wrap_content"

    android:text="I'm normal!"
  />
  <CheckBox
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="        "
    android:button="@drawable/fancycheck"
    android:background="@drawable/btn_check_label_background"
  />
</LinearLayout>

This gives us a look like this:

Figure 10. The FancyCheck application, showing a focused and checked 

CheckBox

Note that our CheckBox text is blank. The reason is that CheckBox is expecting 
the   graphics   to   be   38px   wide.   Since   ours   are   substantially   larger,   the 
CheckBox  images   overlap   the   text.   Fixing   this   would   require   substantial 
work. It is simplest to fill the CheckBox text with some whitespace, then use 
a separate TextView for our CheckBox caption.

More Fun With ListViews

One of the most important widgets in your toolbelt is the  ListView. Some 
activities   are   purely  a  ListView,   to  allow   the   user   to   sift   through  a   few 
choices...or perhaps a few thousand. We already saw in  The Busy Coder's 
Guide to Android Development  how to create "fancy ListViews", where you 
have complete control over the list rows themselves. In this chapter, we will 
cover   some   additional   techniques   you   can   use   to   make   your  ListView 
widgets be pleasant for your users to work with.

Giant Economy-Size Dividers

You may have noticed that the preference UI has what behaves a lot like a 
ListView, but with a curious characteristic: not everything is selectable:

Figure 11. A PreferenceScreen UI

You   may have  thought  that  this  required  some  custom widget, or some 
fancy on-the-fly View handling, to achieve this effect.

If so, you would have been wrong.

It turns out that any ListView can exhibit this behavior. In this section, we 
will see how this is achieved and a reusable framework for creating such a 
ListView.

Choosing What Is Selectable

There are two methods in the Adapter hierarchy that let you control what is 
and is not selectable in a ListView:

•

•

areAllItemsSelectable()  should   return  true  for   ordinary  ListView 
widgets  and  false  for  ListView  widgets  where  some   items   in the 
Adapter are selectable and others are not

isEnabled(), given a position, should return true if the item at that 
position should be selectable and false otherwise

More Fun With ListViews

Given these two, it is "merely" a matter of overriding your chosen Adapter 
class and implementing these two methods as appropriate to get the visual 
effect you desire.

As one might expect, this is not quite as easy as it may sound.

For   example,   suppose   you   have   a   database   of   books,   and   you   want   to 
present   a   list   of   book   titles   for   the   user   to   choose   from.   Furthermore, 
suppose you have arranged for the books to be in alphabetical order within 
each major book style (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.), courtesy of a well-crafted 
ORDER BY clause on your query. And suppose you want to have headings, like 
on the preferences screen, for those book styles.

If   you   simply   take   the  Cursor  from   that   query   and   hand   it   to   a 
SimpleCursorAdapter, the two methods cited above will be implemented as 
the default, saying every row is selectable. And, since every row is a book, 
that is what you want...for the books.

To get the headings in place, your  Adapter  needs to mix the headings in 
with the books (so they all appear in the proper sequence), return a custom 
View  for each (so headings look different than the books), and implement 
the two methods that control whether the headings or books are selectable. 
There is no easy way to do this from a simple query.

Instead,   you   need   to   be   a   bit   more   creative,   and   wrap   your 
SimpleCursorAdapter  in something that can intelligently inject the section 
headings.

Composition for Sections

Jeff Sharkey, author of  CompareEverywhere and all-around Android guru, 
demonstrated a way of using composition to create a ListView with section 
headings. The code presented here is based on his implementation, with a 
few alterations. As his original code was released under the GPLv3, bear in 
mind that the code presented here  is  also released under the GPLv3, as

opposed to the Apache License 2.0 that most of the book's code uses as a 
license.

The pattern is fairly simple:

•

•

•

•

Create   one  Adapter  for   each   section.   For   example,   in   the   book 
scenario described above, you might have one  SimpleCursorAdapter 
for each book style (one for Fiction, one for Non-Fiction, etc.).

Put   each   of   those  Adapter  objects   into   a   container  Adapter, 
associating each with a heading name.

Implement, on your container Adapter subclass, a method to return 
the View for a heading, much like you might implement getView() to 
return a View for a row

Put the container Adapter in the ListView, and everything flows from 
there

You   will   see   this   implemented   in   the  ListView/Sections  sample   project, 
which  is  another riff on the "list  of  lorem ipsum  words" sample you  see 
scattered throughout the Busy Coder books.

The   layout   for   the   screen   is   just   a  ListView,   because   the   activity   – 
SectionedDemo – is just a ListActivity:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ListView
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:id="@android:id/list"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  android:drawSelectorOnTop="true"
/>

Most of the smarts can be found in  SectionedAdapter. This class extends 
Adapter  and delegates all of the  Adapter  methods to a list of child  Adapter 
objects:

    Section(String caption, Adapter adapter) {
      this.caption=caption;
      this.adapter=adapter;
    }
  }
}

SectionedAdapter holds a List of Section objects, where a Section is simply a 
name and an  Adapter  holding the contents of that section of the list. You 
can give  SectionedAdapter  the  details  of  a  Section  via  addSection()  –  the 
sections will appear in the order in which they were added.

SectionedAdapter  synthesizes   the  overall   list  of  objects   from  each  of   the 
adapters, plus the section headings. So, for example, the implementation of 
getView()  walks   each   section   and   returns   either   a  View  for   the   section 
header (if the requested item is the first one for that section) or the  View 
from the section's adapter (if the requested item is any other one in this 
section). The same holds true for getCount() and getItem().

One thing that  SectionedAdapter  needs to do, though, is ensure that the 
pool   of   section   header  View  objects   is   recycled   separately   from   each 
section's   own   pool   of  View  objects.   To   do   this,  SectionedAdapter  takes 
advantage of getViewTypeCount(), by returning the total number of distinct 
types of View objects from all section Adapters plus one for its own header 
View pool. Similarly, getItemViewType() considers the 0th View type to be the 
header View pool, with the pools for each Adapter in sequence starting from 
1. This pattern requires that each section Adapter have its View type numbers

starting from 0 and incrementing by 1, but most  Adapter  classes only use 
one View type and do not even implement their own getViewTypeCount() or 
getItemViewType(), so this will work most of the time.

To use a  SectionedAdapter,  SectionedDemo simply creates one, adds in three 
sections   (with   three   sets   of   the  lorem   ipsum  words),   and   attaches   the 
SectionedAdapter to the ListView for the ListActivity:

Figure 12. A ListView using a SectionedAdapter, showing one header and part 

of a list

Here, the headers are simple bits of text with an appropriate style applied. 
Your section headers, of course, can be as complex as you like.

From Head To Toe

Perhaps you do not need section headers scattered throughout your list. If 
you only need extra "fake rows" at the beginning or end of your list, you can 
use header and footer views.

ListView supports addHeaderView() and addFooterView() methods that allow 
you to add  View objects to the beginning and end of the list, respectively. 
These View objects otherwise behave like regular rows, in that they are part 
of the scrolled area and will scroll off the screen if the list is long enough. If 
you want fixed headers or footers, rather than put them in the  ListView 
itself, put them outside the ListView, perhaps using a LinearLayout.

To   demonstrate   header   and   footer   views,   take   a   peek   at 
ListView/HeaderFooter, particularly the HeaderFooterDemo class:

built   via  buildFooter(),   returning   a  TextView  that   shows   how   long   the 
activity has been running, updated every second. The list itself is the ever-
popular list of lorem ipsum words.

When initially displayed, the header is visible but the footer is not, because 
the list is too long:

Control Your Selection

The  stock  Android   UI   for  a  selected  ListView  row   is   fairly  simplistic:   it 
highlights   the   row   in   orange...and   nothing   more.   You   can   control   the 
Drawable  used   for   selection   via   the
and 
android:drawSelectorOnTop  attributes   on   the  ListView  element   in   your 
layout. However, even those simply apply some generic look to the selected 
row.

 android:listSelector 

It may be you want to do something more elaborate for a selected row, such 
as changing the row around to expose more information. Maybe you have 
thumbnail   photos   but   only   display   the   photo   on   the   selected   row.   Or 
perhaps   you   want   to   show   some   sort   of   secondary   line   of   text,   like   a 
person's instant messenger status, only on the selected row. Or, there may 
be times you want a more subtle indication of the selected item than having 
the  whole   row  show   up   in  some   neon  color.  The  stock  Android   UI   for 
highlighting a selection will not do any of this for you.

That just means you have to do it yourself. The good news is, it is not very 
difficult.

Create a Unified Row View

The simplest way to accomplish this is for each row View to have all of the 
widgets you want for the selected-row perspective, but with the "extra stuff" 
flagged as  invisible at the outset. That  way, rows   initially  look "normal" 
when put into the list – all you need to do is toggle the invisible widgets to 
visible when a row gets selected and toggle them back to invisible when a 
row is de-selected.

For   example,   in   the  ListView/Selector  project,   you   will   find   a   row.xml 
layout representing a row in a list:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:orientation="horizontal"

42

  android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
  android:layout_height="fill_parent" >
  <View
    android:id="@+id/bar"
    android:background="#FFFF0000"
    android:layout_width="5px" 
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:visibility="invisible"
  />
  <TextView
    android:id="@+id/label"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:textSize="10pt"
    android:paddingTop="2px"
    android:paddingBottom="2px"
    android:paddingLeft="5px"
  />
</LinearLayout>

There is a TextView representing the bulk of the row. Before it, though, on 
the left, is a plain View named bar. The background of the View is set to red 
(android:background = "#FFFF0000") and the width to 5px. More importantly, 
it is set to be invisible (android:visibility = "invisible"). Hence, when the 
row is put into a  ListView, the red bar is not seen...until we make the bar 
visible.

Configure the List, Get Control on Selection

Next, we need to set up a ListView and arrange to be notified when rows are 
selected   and   de-selected.   That   is   merely   a   matter   of   calling 
setOnItemSelectedListener()  for   the  ListView,   providing   a   listener   to   be 
notified   on   a   selection   change.   You   can   see   that   in   the   context   of   a 
ListActivity in our SelectorDemo class:

package com.commonsware.android.listview;

import android.app.ListActivity;
import android.content.Context;

SelectorDemo  sets   up   a  SelectorAdapter,   which   follow   the   view-wrapper 
pattern   established   in  The   Busy   Coder's   Guide   to   Android   Development. 
Each row is created from the layout shown earlier, with a  SelectorWrapper 
providing access to both the TextView (for setting the text in a row) and the 
bar View.

Change the Row

Our  AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener  instance   keeps   track   of   the   last 
selected   row   (lastRow).   When   the   selection   changes   to   another   row   in 
onItemSelected(),  we   make   the   bar   from   the   last  selected   row   invisible, 
before   we   make   the   bar   visible   on   the   newly-selected   row.   In 
onNothingSelected(), we make the bar invisible and make our last selected 
row be null.

The net effect is that as the selection changes, we toggle the bar off and on 
as needed to indicate which is the selected row.

In the layout for the activity's ListView, we turn off the regular highlighting:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ListView
  xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:id="@android:id/list"
  android:layout_width="fill_parent" 
  android:layout_height="fill_parent"
  android:listSelector="#00000000"
/>

The result is we are controlling the highlight, in the form of the red bar:

Obviously, what we do to highlight a row could be much more elaborate 
than what is demonstrated here. At the same time, it needs to be fairly 
quick to execute, lest the list appear to be too sluggish.

CHAPTER 4

Show Up At Home

One of the oft-requested features added in Android 1.5 is the ability to add 
live elements to the home screen. Called "app widgets", these can be added 
by users via a long-tap on the home screen and choosing an appropriate 
widget from the available  roster. Android ships with  a few  app widgets, 
such as a music player, but developers can add their own – in this chapter, 
we will see how this is done.

For the purposes of this book, "app widgets" will refer to these items that go 
on the home screen. Other uses of the term "widget" will be reserved for 
the UI widgets, subclasses of View, usually found in the android.widget Java 
package.

East is East, and West is West...

Part  of   the  reason   it   took  as   long  as   it  did   for  app  widgets   to   become 
available is security.

Android's security model is based heavily on Linux user, file, and process 
security. Each application is (normally) associated with a unique user ID. 
All of its files are owned by that user, and its process(es) run as that user. 
This   prevents   one   application   from   modifying   the   files   of   another   or 
otherwise injecting their own code into another running process.

In particular, the core Android team wanted to find a way that would allow 
app widgets to be displayed by the home screen application, yet have their 
content   come   from  another   application.   It  would   be  dangerous   for   the 
home  screen to run arbitrary code  itself or somehow  allow  its  UI to  be 
directly manipulated by another process.

The app widget architecture, therefore, is set up to keep the home screen 
application independent from any code that puts app widgets on that home 
screen, so bugs in one cannot harm the other.

The Big Picture for a Small App Widget

The   way   Android   pulls   off   this   bit   of   security   is   through   the   use   of 
RemoteViews.

The application component that supplies the UI for an app widget is not an 
Activity, but rather a  BroadcastReceiver  (often in tandem with a  Service). 
The  BroadcastReceiver, in turn, does not inflate a normal  View  hierarchy, 
like   an  Activity  would,   but   instead   inflates  a   layout   into  a  RemoteViews 
object.

RemoteViews  encapsulates  a   limited  edition  of   normal  widgets,   in  such  a 
fashion   that   the  RemoteViews  can   be   "easily"   transported   across   process 
boundaries. You configure the  RemoteViews  via your  BroadcastReceiver  and 
make those  RemoteViews available to Android. Android in turn delivers the 
RemoteViews  to   the   app   widget   host   (usually   the   home   screen),   which 
renders them to the screen itself.

This architectural choice has many impacts:

1. You do not have access to the full range of widgets and containers. 
You   can   use  FrameLayout,  LinearLayout,   and  RelativeLayout  for 
containers,   and  AnalogClock,
 ImageButton, 
ImageView, ProgressBar, and TextView for widgets.

2. The   only   user   input   you   can   get   is   clicks   of   the  Button  and 
ImageButton  widgets.   In   particular,   there   is   no  EditText  for   text 
input.

3. Because   the   app   widgets   are   rendered   in   another   process,   you 
cannot   simply   register   an  OnClickListener  to   get   button   clicks; 
rather, you tell RemoteViews a PendingIntent to invoke when a given 
button is clicked.

4. You   do   not   hold   onto   the  RemoteViews  and   reuse   them  yourself. 
Rather, the pattern appears to be that you create and send out a 
brand-new  RemoteViews whenever you want to change the contents 
of   the   app   widget.   This,   coupled   with   having   to   transport   the 
RemoteViews across process boundaries, means that updating the app 
widget   is   rather   expensive   in   terms   of   CPU   time,   memory,   and 
battery life.

5. Because   the   component   handling   the   updates  

is   a 
BroadcastReceiver, you have to be quick (lest you take too long and 
Android   consider   you   to   have   timed   out),   you   cannot   use 
background   threads,  and  your  component   itself   is   lost  once   the 
request has been completed. Hence, if your update might take a 
while, you will probably want to have the BroadcastReceiver start a 
Service and have the Service do the long-running task and eventual 
app widget update.

Crafting App Widgets

This will become somewhat easier to understand in the context of some 
sample code. In the  AppWidget/TwitterWidget  project, you will find an app 
widget that shows the latest tweet in your Twitter timeline. If you have read 
Android Programming Tutorials, you will recognize the JTwitter JAR we will 
use for accessing the Twitter Web service.

The Manifest

First, we need to register our  BroadcastReceiver  (and, if relevant,  Service) 
implementation   in   our  AndroidManifest.xml  file,   along   with   a   few   extra 
features:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      package="com.commonsware.android.appwidget"
      android:versionCode="1"
      android:versionName="1.0">
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <application android:label="@string/app_name">
        <activity android:name=".TWPrefs"
                  android:label="@string/app_name">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
            <intent-filter>
                <action 
android:name="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE" />
            </intent-filter>
      </activity>
        <receiver android:name=".TwitterWidget"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:icon="@drawable/tw_icon">
            <intent-filter>
                <action
                    android:name="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE" />
            </intent-filter>
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.appwidget.provider"
                android:resource="@xml/widget_provider" />
        </receiver>
        <service android:name=".TwitterWidget$UpdateService" />
    </application>
</manifest>

Here we have an <activity>, a <receiver>, and a <service>. Of note:

• Our <receiver> has android:label and android:icon attributes, which 
are   not   normally   needed   on  BroadcastReceiver  declarations. 
However, in this case, those are used for the entry that goes in the 
menu of available widgets to add to the home screen. Hence, you 
will   probably   want   to   supply   values   for   both   of   those,   and   use 
appropriate   resources   in   case   you   want   translations   for   other 
languages.

  an

the 
android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE  action.   This   means   we 
will get control whenever Android wants us to update the content of 
our app widget. There may be other actions we want to monitor – 
more on this in a later section.

 <intent-filter> 

• Our  <receiver>  also has a  <meta-data>  element, indicating that its 
android.appwidget.provider  details   can   be   found   in   the 
res/xml/widget_provider.xml  file. This metadata is described in the 
next section.

• Our  <activity>  has two <intent-filter> elements, the normal "put 
me   in   the   Launcher"   one   and   one   looking   for   an   action   of 
android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE.

The Metadata

Next,  we  need to define  the  app  widget  provider   metadata. This   has  to 
reside   at   the   location   indicated   in   the   manifest   –   in   this   case,   in 
res/xml/widget_provider.xml:

<appwidget-provider xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  android:minWidth="292dip"
  android:minHeight="72dip"
  android:updatePeriodMillis="900000"
  android:configure="com.commonsware.android.appwidget.TWPrefs"
/>

Here, we provide four pieces of information:

•

The minimum width and height of the app widget (android:minWidth 
and  android:minHeight).  These  are  approximate   –   the  app  widget 
host (e.g., home screen) will tend to convert these values into "cells" 
based upon the overall layout of the UI where the app widgets will 
reside.   However,  they  should   be   no  smaller   than   the   minimums 
cited here.

The frequency in which Android should request an update of the 
widget's contents (android:updatePeriodMillis). This is expressed in 
terms of milliseconds, so a value  of  900000  is  a 15-minute  update 
cycle.

• An activity class that will be used to configure the widget when it is 
first added to the screen (android:configure). This will be described 
in greater detail in a later section.

The   configuration   activity   is   optional.   However,   if   you   skip   the 
configuration activity, you do need to tell Android the initial layout to use 
for the app widget, via an android:initialLayout attribute.

The Layout

Eventually,  you  are  going   to   need  a   layout   that  describes  what  the  app 
widget looks like. So long as you stick to the widget and container classes 
noted above, this layout can otherwise look like any other layout in your 
project.

For example, here is the layout for the TwitterWidget:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:background="#FF000088"
    >
  <ImageButton android:id="@+id/refresh"
    android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
    android:layout_alignParentRight="true"
    android:src="@drawable/refresh"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  />
  <ImageButton android:id="@+id/configure"
    android:layout_alignParentBottom="true"
    android:layout_alignParentRight="true"
    android:src="@drawable/configure"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
  />
  <TextView android:id="@+id/friend"
    android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
    android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
    android:layout_toLeftOf="@id/refresh"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:gravity="left"

    android:textStyle="bold"
    android:singleLine="true"
    android:ellipsize="end"
  />
  <TextView android:id="@+id/status"
    android:layout_below="@id/friend"
    android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
    android:layout_toLeftOf="@id/refresh"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    android:gravity="top"
    android:singleLine="false"
    android:lines="4"
  />
</RelativeLayout>

All we have is a TextView to show the latest tweet, plus another one for the 
person issuing the tweet, and a pair of ImageButton widgets to allow the user 
to manually refresh the latest tweet and launch the configuration activity.

The BroadcastReceiver

Next, we need a BroadcastReciever that can get control when Android wants 
us to update our RemoteViews for our app widget. To simplify this, Android 
supplies an  AppWidgetProvider  class we can extend, instead of the normal 
BroadcastReceiver. This simply looks at the received Intent and calls out to 
an appropriate lifecycle method based on the requested action.

The one method that invariably needs to be implemented on the provider 
is onUpdate(). Other lifecycle methods may be of interest and are discussed 
later in this chapter.

For   example,   here   is   the
AppWidgetProvider for TwitterWidget:

 onUpdate() 

implementation   of   the 

@Override
public void onUpdate(Context ctxt,
                     AppWidgetManager mgr,
                     int[] appWidgetIds) {
  ctxt.startService(new Intent(ctxt, UpdateService.class));
}

If our RemoteViews could be rapidly constructed, we could do the work right 
here. However, in our case, we need to make a Web service call to Twitter, 
which might take a while, so we instead call startService() on the Service 
we declared in our manifest, to have it make the updates.

The Service

The real work for  TwitterWidget  is mostly done in an  UpdateService  inner 
class of TwitterWidget.

UpdateService  does not  extend  Service,  but  rather extends  IntentService. 
IntentService  is designed for patterns like this one, where our service is 
started   multiple  times, with  each   "start"  representing a  distinct  piece  of 
work   to   be   accomplished   (in   this   case,   updating   an   app   widget   from 
Twitter). IntentService allows us to implement onHandleIntent() to do this 
work, and it arranges for  onHandleIntent()  to be called on a background 
thread. Hence, we do not need to deal with starting or stopping our thread, 
or even stopping our service  when there is  no more  work to be done  – 
Android handles that automatically.

Here is the onHandleIntent() implementation from UpdateService:

@Override
public void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
  ComponentName me=new ComponentName(this,
                                   TwitterWidget.class);
  AppWidgetManager mgr=AppWidgetManager.getInstance(this);

  mgr.updateAppWidget(me, buildUpdate(this));
}

To   update   the  RemoteViews  for   our   app   widget,   we   need   to   build   those 
RemoteViews  (delegated   to   a  buildUpdate()  helper   method)   and   tell   an 
AppWidgetManager  to update the widget via  updateAppWidget(). In this case, 
we   use  a  version  of  updateAppWidget()  that   takes  a  ComponentName  as   the 
identifier of the widget to be updated. Note that this means that we will 
update all instances of this app widget presently in use – the concept of 
multiple   app   widget   instances   is   covered   in   greater   detail  later  in   this 
chapter.

Working with RemoteViews is a bit like trying to tie your shoes while wearing 
mittens – it may be possible, but it is a bit clumsy. In this case, rather than 
using methods like findViewById() and then calling methods on individual 
widgets,   we   need   to   call   methods   on  RemoteViews  itself,   providing   the 
identifier   of   the   widget  we  wish   to   modify.   This   is   so  our   requests   for 
changes can be serialized for transport to the home screen process. It does, 
however, mean that our view-updating code looks a fair bit different than it 
would if this were the main View of an activity or row of a ListView.

For example, here is the  buildUpdate()  method from  UpdateService, which 
builds   a  RemoteViews  containing   the   latest   Twitter   information,   using 
account information pulled from shared preferences:

private RemoteViews buildUpdate(Context context) {
  RemoteViews updateViews=new RemoteViews(context.getPackageName(),
                                        R.layout.widget);
  String user=prefs.getString("user", null);
  String password=prefs.getString("password", null);

  if (user!=null && password!=null) {
    Twitter client=new Twitter(user, password);
    List<Twitter.Status> timeline=client.getFriendsTimeline();

    if (timeline.size()>0) {
      Twitter.Status s=timeline.get(0);

      updateViews.setTextViewText(R.id.friend,
                                 s.user.screenName);
      updateViews.setTextViewText(R.id.status,
                                 s.text);

      Intent i=new Intent(this, TwitterWidget.class);
      PendingIntent pi=PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
                                                0  , i,
                                                0);

      updateViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.refresh,
                                        pi);

      i=new Intent(this, TWPrefs.class);
      pi=PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0  , i, 0);
      updateViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.configure,
                                        pi);
    }
  }

  return(updateViews);
}

To  create   the  RemoteViews,  we   use  a  constructor   that   takes  our   package 
name  and   the   identifier   of   our   layout.   This  gives   us   a  RemoteViews  that 
contains all of the widgets we declared in that layout, just as if we inflated 
the layout using a LayoutInflater. The difference, of course, is that we have 
a RemoteViews object, not a View, as the result.

We then use methods like:

•

•

setTextViewText()  to set the text on a  TextView  in the  RemoteViews, 
given the  identifier of the  TextView  within the  layout  we wish  to 
manipulate

setOnClickPendingIntent()  to   provide   a  PendingIntent  that   should 
get fired off when a Button or ImageButton is clicked

Note, of course, that Android does not know anything about Twitter – the 
Twitter object comes from a JTwitter JAR located in the  libs/ directory of 
our project.

The Configuration Activity

Way back in the manifest, we included an <activity> element for a TWPrefs 
activity. And, in our widget metadata XML file, we said that TWPrefs was the 
android:configure  attribute value. In our  RemoteViews  for the widget itself, 
we connect a configure button to launch TWPrefs when clicked.

The net of all of this is that TWPrefs is the configuration activity. Specifically:

•

•

It will be launched when we request to add this widget to our home 
screen

It will be re-launched whenever we click the configure button in the 
widget itself

For the latter scenario, the activity need be nothing special. In fact, TWPrefs 
is mostly just a PreferenceActivity, updating the SharedPreferences for this 
application  with  the  user's  Twitter  screen  name  and  password,  used  for 
logging into Twitter and fetching the latest timeline entry.

The former scenario – defining a configuration activity in the metadata – 
requires a bit more work, though.

If we were to leave this out, and not have an android:configure attribute in 
the metadata, once the user chose to add our widget to their home screen, 
the widget would immediately appear. Behind the scenes, Android would 
ask our  AppWidgetProvider  to supply the  RemoteViews  for the  widget body 
right away.

However, when we declare that we want a configuration activity, we must 
build   the   initial  RemoteViews  ourselves  and   return   them  as   the  activity's 
result. Behind the scenes, Android uses startActivityForResult() to launch 
our configuration activity, then looks at the result and uses the associated 
RemoteViews to create the initial look of the widget.

This approach is prone to code duplication, and it is not completely clear 
why Android elected to build the widget framework this way.

That being said, here is the implementation of TWPrefs:

package com.commonsware.android.appwidget;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.appwidget.AppWidgetManager;
import android.appwidget.AppWidgetProvider;
import android.content.ComponentName;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.preference.PreferenceActivity;
import android.view.KeyEvent;
import android.widget.RemoteViews;

public class TWPrefs extends PreferenceActivity {
  private static String 
CONFIGURE_ACTION="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE";
  
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    
    addPreferencesFromResource(R.xml.preferences);
  }
  
  @Override

  public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    if (keyCode==KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) {
      if (CONFIGURE_ACTION.equals(getIntent().getAction())) {
        Intent intent=getIntent();
        Bundle extras=intent.getExtras();
  
        if (extras!=null) {
          int id=extras.getInt(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID, 
                               AppWidgetManager.INVALID_APPWIDGET_ID);
          AppWidgetManager mgr=AppWidgetManager.getInstance(this);
          RemoteViews views=new RemoteViews(getPackageName(),
                                          R.layout.widget);
  
          mgr.updateAppWidget(id, views);
  
          Intent result=new Intent();
  
          result.putExtra(AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID,
                           id);
          setResult(RESULT_OK, result);
          sendBroadcast(new Intent(this,
                                   TwitterWidget.class));
        }
      }
    }
    
    return(super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event));
  }
}

We are using the same activity for two cases: for the initial configuration 
and for later on-demand reconfiguration via the configure button in the 
widget.   We   need   to   tell   these  apart.   More   importantly,  we   need   to  get 
control   at   an   appropriate   time   to   set   our   activity   result   in   the   initial 
configuration   case.   Alas,   the   normal   activity   lifecycle   methods   (e.g., 
onDestroy()) are  too  late, and  PreferenceActivity  offers   no  other explicit 
hook to find out when the user dismisses the preference screen.

So, we have to cheat a bit.

Specifically, we hook onKeyDown() and watch for the back button. When the 
back   button   is   pressed,   if  we  were   launched   by   a  widget   configuration 
Intent  (CONFIGURE_ACTION.equals(getIntent().getAction())),   then   we   go 
through and:

• Get our widget instance identifier (described in greater detail later 

in this chapter)

• Get our AppWidgetManager and create a new RemoteViews inflated from 

our widget layout

•

•

•

Pass   the   empty  RemoteViews 
updateAppWidget()

to   the  AppWidgetManager  via 

Call  setResult()  with   an  Intent  wrapping   our   widget   instance 
identifier,   so   Android   knows   we   have   properly   configured   our 
widget

Raise a broadcast  Intent  to ask our  WidgetProvider  to do the  real 
initial version of the widget

This minimizes code duplication, but it does mean there is a slight hiccup, 
where   the  widget   initially  appears   blank,   before   the   first  timeline  entry 
appears. This is largely unavoidable in this case – we cannot wait for Twitter 
to respond since onKeyDown() is called on the UI thread and we need to call 
setResult() now rather than wait for Twitter's response.

Undoubtedly, there are other patterns for handling this situation.

The Result

If  you  compile  and   install all  of  this,  you  will   have  a   new  widget  entry 
available when you long-tap on the home screen background:

To change your Twitter credentials, you can either tap the configure icon in 
the widget or run the Twitter Widget application in your launcher. And, 
clicking the refresh button, or waiting 15 minutes, will cause the widget to 
update its contents.

Another and Another

As indicated above, you can have multiple instances of the same app widget 
outstanding at any one time. For example, one might have multiple picture 
frames, or multiple "show-me-the-latest-RSS-entry" app widgets, one per 
feed.  You  will  distinguish   between   these   in  your  code  via   the   identifier 
supplied in the relevant AppWidgetProvider callbacks (e.g., onUpdate()).

If you want to support separate app widget instances, you will need to store 
your   state   on   a   per-app-widget-identifier   basis.   For   example,   while 
TwitterWidget  uses preferences for the Twitter account details, you might 
need multiple preference files, or use a SQLite database with an app widget 
identifier  column,  or  something   to  distinguish  one  app  widget   instance 
from   another.   You   will   also   need   to   use   an   appropriate   version   of

updateAppWidget()  on  AppWidgetManager  when you update the app widgets, 
one that takes app widget identifiers as the first parameter, so you update 
the proper app widget instances.

Conversely, there is nothing requiring you to support multiple instances as 
independent entities. For example, if you add more than one TwitterWidget 
to your home screen, nothing blows up – they just show the same tweet. In 
the case of TwitterWidget, they might not even show the same tweet all the 
time, since they will update on independent cycles, so one will get newer 
tweets before another.

App Widgets: Their Life and Times

TwitterWidget overrode two AppWidgetProvider methods:

•

•

onUpdate(), invoked when the  android:updatePeriodMillis  time has 
elapsed

onReceive(), the standard BroadcastReceiver callback, used to detect 
when we are invoked with no action, meaning we want to force an 
update due to the refresh button being clicked

There are three other lifecycle methods that  AppWidgetProvider  offers that 
you may be interested in:

•

•

•

onEnabled() will be called when the first widget instance is created 
for this particular widget provider, so if there is anything you need 
to do once for all supported widgets, you can implement that logic 
here

onDeleted() will be called when a widget instance is removed from 
the home screen, in case there is any data you need to clean up 
specific to that instance

onDisabled()  will be called when the last widget instance for this 
provider  is  removed from the  home  screen, so you  can clean up 
anything related to all such widgets

Note, however, that there is a bug in Android 1.5r2, where onDeleted() will 
not be properly called. You will need to implement onReceive() and watch 
for   the  ACTION_APPWIDGET_DELETED  action   in   the   received  Intent  and   call 
onDeleted() yourself. This should be fixed in a future edition of Android.

Controlling Your (App Widget's) Destiny

As  TwitterWidget  illustrates,   you   are   not   limited   to   updating   your   app 
widget   only   based   on   the   timetable   specified   in   your   metadata.   That 
timetable is useful if you can get by with a fixed schedule. However, there 
are cases in which that will not work very well:

•

•

If you want the user to be able to configure the polling period (the 
metadata is baked into your APK and therefore cannot be modified 
at runtime)

If you want the app widget to be updated based on external factors, 
such as a change in location

The recipe shown in TwitterWidget will let you use AlarmManager (described 
in a  later chapter) or proximity alerts or whatever to trigger updates. All 
you need to do is:

• Arrange for something to broadcast an Intent that will be picked up 

by the BroadcastReceiver you are using for your app widget provider

• Have the provider process that Intent directly or pass it along to a 

Service (such as an IntentService as shown in TwitterWidget)

Being a Good Host

In addition to creating your own app widgets, it is possible to host app 
widgets. This is mostly aimed for those creating alternative home screen 
applications, so they can take advantage of the same app widget framework 
and all the app widgets being built for it.

This is not very well documented at this juncture, but it apparently involves 
the AppWidgetHost and AppWidgetHostView classes. The latter is a View and so
